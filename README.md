Celebrity Meter
===============

About
-----
**Celebrity Meter** is a simple software to calculate online popularity of a celebrity and compare it with others' celebrity.
It collects data from **Google**, **Wikipedia**, **IMDb** and **Twitter** and calculates a **rank** value.

I developed this as my homework for **Introduction to Natural Language Processing** course of 
M.Sc. Programme in Computer Engineering in Yildiz Technical University.
